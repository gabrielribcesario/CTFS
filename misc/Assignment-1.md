# Assignment 1

<h3 align="left">Continuous-Time Fourier Series</h3>

1. Calculate the coefficients of the Fourier Series (Compact Trigonometric and Exponential);
2. Calculate the MSE and the RMSE between the Fourier Series approximation and the original function;
3. Plot the evolution of items 1 (amplitude of harmonics) and 2, along with the Fourier Series approximation as more harmonics are added.

Functions to be approximated:
1. Sine
2. Square
3. Sawtooth
4. Triangle

Stopping criteria: **RMSE < 0.1**
